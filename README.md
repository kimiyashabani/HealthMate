# Health Mate

Health mate is an Android application developed for monitoring the health status of people with cardiovascular diseases but the features does not end here! 
Everyone knows that doctors and professional medicals use specific words, terminologies and jargons that are not easily undrestandable for most of the people. For tackling this problem, I gathered a dataset containing terminolgies and jargons related to Cardiology to fine-tune llama 2 for this specific usecase.
This model is then integrated within the application for user to :
- ask their questions
- understand their symptoms
- understand treatment plans
- get to know their overall disease management
